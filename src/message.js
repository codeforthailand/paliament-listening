Thank you very much for being curious about how our project "Parliament Listening" works. :)

We actually like that you inspect our code; however, you won't see much because it's minified. Because we know that there are people like you out there that would like to learn and help, that's why we publicly host our code on Github.

Github URL: github.com/codeforthailand/parliament-listening

Moreover, we're more than happy to recieve your comments and feedback. You can either send us through the Github repository or our social media accounts.

Have a nice day and happy Coding!
